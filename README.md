# Playing with the Google tasks API

I'd like to do the following:
- list tasks
- move tasks from one tasklist to another (like send all of today's tasks to a tasklist called "tomorrow")
- move a random task from tasklist "backlog" to another tasklist

Other goals are:
- use natural language instead of command line flags
- have a shell interface (like "hammer shell")
- curses interface
